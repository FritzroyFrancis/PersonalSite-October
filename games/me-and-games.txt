<p>My earliest memories involving me sitting on my dads lap playing Renegade on the NES when I was about 3 years old. It's kind of strange to recall something from that long ago, but it just goes to show how much video games have been in my life. I really got into it when I got my Playstation console on Christmas of 1998. At first, racing and sports games were all I played, but as I got older, my tastes change and I'm now more into games than I have ever been before.</p><br /><p>Recently, I've had the ambitions of creating video games, and the barrier to entry is lower than ever before thanks to Unreal Engine 4, Crytek and especially Unity. Hopefully, when the time is right and the oppurtunity cost is low, I can spend some time to create the game that I've always wanted to play... or, at least, create a game someone wouldn't mind playing. :)</p><!--<br /><p>I created a blog for a video games class I took at St John's University (yes, the course is one of the universities' top secrets, including a wine-tasting class). I decided to take a few of those blog posts and bring them here for your viewing pleasure (although... let's say I didn't necesarily major in good writing. Oh well, I'm my own worst critic) The link is <a href="../blogs/index.php">here</a>.</p>-->
